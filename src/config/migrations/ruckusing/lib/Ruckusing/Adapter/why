The ruckusing framework requires a constant to be defined that points to a directory that matches the directory structure it itself uses.

From there it will require files to load. If the plugin is installed with composer we have no way of determining where ruckusing is installed.

This doesn't matter any way as all it's files are autoloaded. Instead we just give it a directory that matches it's own structure with no files.

Ruckusing will then scan this directory and not load any files. Then see that all the classes it wanted exist anyway and happily continue on.
