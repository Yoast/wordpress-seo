## Requirements
The Yoast/Components package is not pre-build. So if you would like to include `@yoast/components` into your project we will need a few steps to set it up.

### Loading Javascript. 

1. Install the package by running `yarn add @yoast/components`.
2. Include Yoast/components into the babel-loader of your `webpack.config`. This will look something like this: `include: [ paths.appSrc, /node_modules[/\\](yoast-components|@yoast)[/\\].*/ ]`
3. It can be that you will need presets for the `babel-loader`. These are: `presets: [ "@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react" ]`
	
	Note that you will also need to install these presets. Run `yarn add --dev @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react`

### Loading CSS

Because we are importing CSS in our JavaScript, your JavaScript bundler needs to be able to interpret CSS.  

Therefore, you will need to use a css-loader in your bundler in order to use this package.

E.g. in Webpack: https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/

Make sure to add the CSS imports to your project. `import "@yoast/components/base";` This is a collection of all the CSS in `@yoast/components`.
It should be imported in App.js or index.js of your react project.

## Using the MultiSelect
The `MultiSelect` component requires the presence of both [jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/) and [Select2](https://select2.org/getting-started/installation). Make sure that they are available on the global window object before the component is instantiated.

If you are working in a WordPress environment, WordPress will automatically load jQuery for you so you only need to worry about Select2.
