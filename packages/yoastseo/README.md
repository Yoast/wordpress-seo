# YoastSEO.js

Text analysis and assessment library in JavaScript. This library can generate interesting metrics about a text and assess these metrics to give you an assessment which can be used to improve the text.

![Screenshot of the assessment of the given text](/packages/yoastseo/images/assessments.png)

Also included is a preview of the Google search results which can be assessed using the library.

## Installation

You can install YoastSEO.js using npm:

```bash
npm install yoastseo
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add yoastseo
```

## Usage

You can either use YoastSEO.js using the web worker API or use the internal components directly.

Because a web worker must be a separate script in the browser you first need to create a script for inside the web worker:

```js
import { AnalysisWebWorker } from "yoastseo";

const worker = new AnalysisWebWorker( self );
worker.register();
```

Then in a different script you have the following code:

```js
import { AnalysisWorkerWrapper, createWorker, Paper } from "yoastseo";

// `url` needs to be the full URL to the script for the browser to know where to load the worker script from.
// This should be the script created by the previous code-snippet.
const url = "https://my-site-url.com/path-to-webworker-script.js"

const worker = new AnalysisWorkerWrapper( createWorker( url ) );

worker.initialize( {
    locale: "en_US",
    contentAnalysisActive: true,
    keywordAnalysisActive: true,
    logLevel: "ERROR",
} ).then( () => {
    // The worker has been configured, we can now analyze a Paper.
    const paper = new Paper( "Text to analyze", {
        keyword: "analyze",
    } );

    return worker.analyze( paper );
} ).then( ( results ) => {
    console.log( 'Analysis results:' );
    console.log( results );
} ).catch( ( error ) => {
    console.error( 'An error occured while analyzing the text:' );
    console.error( error );
} );
```

### Usage of internal components

If you want to have a more barebones API, or are in an environment without access to Web Worker you can use the internal objects:

```js
import { AbstractResearcher, Paper } from "yoastseo";

const paper = new Paper( "Text to analyze", {
    keyword: "analyze",
} );
const researcher = new AbstractResearcher( paper );

console.log( researcher.getResearch( "wordCountInText" ) );
```

**Note: This is currently a synchronous API, but will become an asynchronous API in the future.**

<sup>1</sup> This means the default upper limit of 20 words has been verified for this language, or the upper limit has been changed.

<sup>2</sup> These are used for internal linking, insights and keyphrase-related analyses.

<sup>3</sup> There is no existing Flesch reading ease formula for these languages.

<sup>4</sup> This means that the functionality for this assessment is currently not available for these languages.

<sup>5</sup> The Passive voice check for Japanese is not implemented since the structure is the same as the potential form and can additionally be used for an honorific purpose. Identifying whether a verb is in its passive, honorific or potential form is problematic without contextual information.

The following readability assessments are available for all languages:
- sentence length (with a default upper limit of 20 words, see<sup>1</sup> above )
- paragraph length
- subheading distribution
