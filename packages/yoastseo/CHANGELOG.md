## 1.54.0 June 11th, 2019
### Added
* Adds an improved internal linking functionality behind a feature flag. For now, this new functionality is disabled by default. Specifically, the new internal linking functionality has the following improvements:
  * Changes the way prominent words are extracted for the Internal linking suggestions and Insights features. No multiple-word combinations are considered anymore, but single words only. For languages with morphological support (currently English and German) different morphological forms of words (e.g., `link`, `linking`, `links`, `linked`) are recognized and collapsed together, which improves the performance of the said features.
  * Changes the Insights functionality in the following way: no words that occurred less than 5 times in the text of the post are displayed. For languages with morphological support (for now, English and German) different word forms of the same word are collapsed based on their stem/base form (e.g., the stem of words `link`, `linking`, `links`, and `linked` is `link`). If the stem coincides with an actual word used in the text, it is displayed to the user in the list of Insights. If the stem does not coincide with any words used in the text, the first word form of the stem that occurred in the text will be used for display.
  * Changes the Internal linking suggestions functionality in the following way: not only the text of the post but also different meta data fields are used for analysis, i.e., title, keyphrase, synonyms, meta description, subheadings (H2 and H3 levels). One occurrence of a word in the said meta data fields is deemed more important than one occurrence of this word inside the text. Stems are further saved in the database and used for matching of prominent words between posts and the internal linking functionality.

    * Keyphrase density: changes scoring schema to account for the length of the keyphrase and changes feedback strings so that we give feedback about the number of occurrences rather than a percentage.
    * Outbound links assessment: changes the scoring schema so that red bullet instead of an orange bullet is shown when you have no outbound links.
    * Image alt attributes: if there are at least 5 images, checks whether the alt tags contain the keyphrase or synoynyms in 30-70% of all images. If there are less than 5 images, 1 image with the keyphrase or synonym in the alt tag is still scored as good.
    * Keyphrase in title: function words preceding the exact match keyphrase are ignored when determining the position of the keyphrase in the title.
    * Keyphrase length: makes the scoring scheme less strict for languages that don't have function word support, so that for these languages keyphrases with 1-6 words are scored as green, 7-9 as orange, and more than 9 as red.
    * Keyphrase in subheading: only takes H2 and H3 level subheadings into account and changes the scoring schema so that 30%-75% of these subheadings need to include the keyphrase or its synonyms. In languages without function word support, a match is only counted if all the words from the keyphrase/synonym appear in the subheading.
    * Text length: on taxonomy pages, the recommended minimum text length is increased from 150 to 250 words.

* Fixes a bug where the Yoast SEO analysis would error if used together with the DelightfulDownloads plugin.

## 1.41.0 October 22nd, 2018

### Added
* Introduces two new principles for keyword recognition:
  * Makes keyphrase recognition flexible with regards to word order. This means that the keyphrase `SEO WordPress plugin` will be found in the sentence `This is the most popular SEO plugin for WordPress.` In order to use exact matches, the keyphrase can be enclosed in quotation marks.
  * When matching keyphrases for the various assessments, the analysis only targets content words and ignores function words (e.g., `the` or `and`). This functionality is available in English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Polish.
* Implements support for word form recognition for keyphrases in English (requires Premium configuration).
* Improves the feedback texts for all SEO and readability assessments.
* Adds functionality to append a query string to the assessment links through the analysis worker.
* Adds an assessment that checks whether your keyword consists only of function words.

### Changed
* The analysis of the following assessments incorporates the new keyword recognition principles:
  * Image alt attributes: checks whether there’s at least one image with an alt tag that contains words from the keyphrase. An exact match isn’t required anymore.
  * Keyphrase in introduction: checks whether words from the keyphrase are matched within one sentence in the introduction or, if not, whether they are present in the first paragraph at all. An exact match isn’t required anymore.
  * Keyphrase in title: still checks whether an exact match of the keyphrase is found in (the beginning of) the title, but now also recommends improvement if all words from the keyphrase are found in the title.
  * Keyphrase length: has new boundaries to check whether the keyphrase is not too long. For languages that have support for function word stripping (see above), only content words are taken into account.
  * Keyphrase in meta description: checks how often all words from the keyphrase are matched within the meta description.
  * Keyphrase in subheading: checks whether at least one subheading contains more than half of the words from the keyphrase. An exact match isn’t required anymore.
  * Keyphrase in slug: checks whether a sufficient number of words from the keyphrase is used in the slug. The number of words required depends on the length of the keyphrase.
  * Keyphrase density: checks whether there are enough keyphrase matches; a match is defined as a sentence that contains all words from the keyphrase. The upper boundary for a good score is higher when word form recognition is available, since in that case the analysis is able to pick up more matches.
  * Link focus keyphrase: the assessment that checks whether you’re using your keyphrase to link to a different article doesn't require an exact match anymore.
  * Keyphrase distribution uses an improved algorithm that checks whether the keyphrase is evenly distributed throughout the text.
* The following assessments will also count synonym matches as keyphrase matches:
  * Image alt attributes
  * Keyphrase in introduction
  * Keyphrase in meta description
  * Keyphrase in subheading
  * Keyphrase distribution
* Deprecates the assessment that checks if stopwords are used within the keyphrase.
* The analysis for related keyphrases only shows assessments relevant for the specific keyphrase. It omits assessments that are non-keyphrase-related and assessments that should only be applied to the focus keyphrase.

### Fixed
* Fixes a bug where the keyword would not be found in the slug when containing punctuation, for example the keyphrase `apples & pears` in the slug `apples-pears`.

## 1.40.0 September 24th, 2018

### Enhancements

* Improves the contrast between the background and the red circle by choosing a different color red.
* Add a clearfix mixin.
* Switches to ESLint in favor of JSHint, JSONLint, JSValidate and JSCS.
* Switches to a custom grunt script to build the lodash templates, `grunt-lodash` is deprecated.
* Adds an argument to `stringToRegex` to specify whether to replace diacritics before building the regex.
* Massively improves test coverage.
* Updates `lodash` from version 3 to version 4.
* Pluralizes certain translations, this makes it possible to correctly translate these strings.

## 1.1: March 1st, 2016

### Backwards incompatible changes

* Passing the title, url and meta description meant for the snippet editor is no longer taken into account. The snippet
editor keeps track of these values itself.
* `callbacks.updateSnippetValues` has been deprecated in favor of `callback.saveSnippetData`. Currently a raw event is
passed to `updateSnippetValues`. This is undesirable because it couples the callback to the DOM. The new
`saveSnippetData` passes the actual data that the user put in the fields.
* The `SnippetPreview` object now requires an options object instead of an `App` object. The `App` object should still be passed inside the options object with the `analyzerApp` key.
* Removed `SnippetPreview` methods:
	* `setFocus`
	* `hideEditIcon`
	* `showEditIcon`
	* `textFeedback`
	* `disableEnter`
* Removed `App` methods:
	* `bindSnippetEvents`
	* `bindEvent`
	* `createEditIcon`
	* `createSnippetPreviewEditIcon`
	* `createSnippetPreviewMeta`
	* `createSnippetPreviewUrl`
	* `createSnippetPreviewTitle`
* Deprecated `App.createSnippetPreview`
* Removed `StringHelper` prototype.
* Removed `PreProcessor` prototype.

### Features

* Completely redesign the snippet editor editing experience:
	* Remove the contenteditable fields
	* Add a decoupled form to edit the title, slug and meta description fields.
	* Add a button to clearly show how to open the snippet editor.
	* Add headings to clearly indicate which part is the snippet preview and which is the editor.
	* Add progress bars to show an indication about the length of the title and meta description.
	* Add carets before the preview and form fields to show which preview belongs to which input field.
* Introduce modules. All non-trivial modules are moved out of `analyzer.js` and moved to the `analyses` folder as module. Where it makes sense we added a `stringProcessing` folder with all the string helper modules.
* Introduces new SnippetPreview functions:
	* toggleEditor
	* closeEditor
	* openEditor
	* updateDataFromDOM
	* changedInput
	* bindEvents
	* updateProgressBars
	* validateFields
	* callRegisteredEventBinder
	* getAnalyzerData
	* refresh
	* renderTemplate
* Introduce `ScoreFormatter.getUndefinedScores` to retrieve all the undefined scores from a scores array.
* Introduce `missingArgument` error that is thrown when an argument is missing in the `App`.
* Massively reduce the required config of the `App`.

### Enhancements

* Start to decouple the SnippetPreview from the scrapers and the analyzer.
* Depend on lodash to improve the readability of our codebase and to standardize certain actions.
* Add an option to the `SnippetPreview` to include a date before the meta description.
* Add a `baseURL` option to the `SnippetPreview` to change the base URL.
* Change the stopwords check to a grey bullet that doesn't count towards the total score.

### Bugfixes

* By default add a trailing slash to the rendered URL, add an option to the `SnippetPreview` to disable this behaviour.
* Show the protocol in the snippet preview if it is HTTPS. Google has this behaviour as well.
* Color the meta description preview gray if the user hasn't set it explicitly.
