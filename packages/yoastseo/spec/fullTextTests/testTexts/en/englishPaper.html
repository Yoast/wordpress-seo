<p>
    My husband &#8211; <a href='https://yoast.com/about-us/team/joost-de-valk/'>Joost de Valk</a> &#8211;
    and I often have discussions on how technology will change our day-to-day life. Joost is an early adopter, while I am much slower
    and more reluctant to technological change. Our discussions are pretty heated. So, what&#8217;s Joost&#8217;s opinion on the future
    of voice search? How dominant will voice search be? And how will search be affected by it?
    I interviewed my early-adopting-voice-addict-husband  to shed some light and perspective on the matter of voice search.
    I did some thinking myself as well. Here, I share our views on what the future of voice search could look like.
    <h2>Voice queries make a lot of sense</h2>
<p>Joost just likes voice. He likes talking to machines. Joost asks Siri to set the timer while he&#8217;s cooking dinner
    and gives orders to Google Home when he wants to listen to some music. So what is it what attracts him in voice search?
    &#8216;I like voice whenever I cannot type,&#8217; Joost answers,  &#8216;So, I use it while I am cooking, or when we are
    in a car together and we have a discussion. Using a voice query is just as easy as typing in a keyword.
    And if you do not have access to a keyboard, voice search is especially useful.&#8217;</p>
<p>I think Joost is right about that: voice queries just make sense.
    Voice search is easy to use (as long as your voice is recognized properly).
    For most people, speaking to a machine is quicker than typing.
    And, you can use voice search everywhere, even when you&#8217;re doing other things.</p>
<h2>Voice results do not (always) make sense</h2>
<p>The results that voice gives us are always singular. Siri will set a timer, Google Home will play the song.
    Joost:  &#8216;Voice results only make sense if you&#8217;re looking for a singular result. If you want to know something specific.
    If you want to end the discussion you&#8217;re having in the car and need to know exactly how many people live in France.
    And also, if you search for a specific restaurant. But if you want to have dinner in a nice restaurant and you&#8217;re not sure which
    one it &#8216;ll be,  you&#8217;ll probably prefer to see some options. And right then and there, is where I think voice results as they work now stop making sense.&#8217;</p>
<p>I started thinking about that. Most search queries people use are not aimed at a singular result.
    People like to browse. People want to choose. That&#8217;s why physical stores have a lot of options.
    People like to browse through different pairs of jeans before they choose which one they&#8217;ll buy.
    Online, we&#8217;ll probably check out different sites or at least different models before we add a pair of jeans to our shopping cart.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re searching for information that is longer than a few sentences, voice result is not very useful either.
    That&#8217;s because it is hard to digest information solely by listening. As a listener, you&#8217;re a very passive receiver of information.
    As a reader,  you can scan a text, you can skip pieces of information or read an important paragraph twice.
    You cannot do that as a listener. As a reader, you&#8217;re much more in control.
    So, if you&#8217;re searching for information about what to do in Barcelona, it makes much more sense to get that information from a book or a screen.</p>
<h2>Search engines are growing towards singular results</h2>
<p>Joost thinks that search engines are working towards singular results. They are developing that type of functionality.
     &#8216;The answer boxes you see in the search results are an example of that,&#8217; Joost explains. &#8216;
    Search engines are trying to give one single answer to a search query. But, in a lot of the cases, people aren&#8217;t searching for one answer.
    In many cases people want to make a choice, they want to browse.&#8217;</p> <h2>So what will the future bring?</h2>
<p>&#8216;I think you&#8217;ll see different applications being connected to each other,&#8217; Joost answers when I ask him what the future of voice search will look like.
    &#8216;Siri, for example, would then be connected to your Apple TV.
    Search results and information would appear on the screen closest to you that Apple controls.
    I think voice will become the dominant search query, but I think screens will continue to be important in presenting search results.&#8217;</p>
