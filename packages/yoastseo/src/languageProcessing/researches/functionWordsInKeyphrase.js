     * We use a word boundary regex that includes whitespaces, en-dashes, and hyphens for all languages.
     * This means that we also consider keyphrases that consist of function words separated by hyphens (e.g. 'two-year-old')
     * as containing only function words. Since many hyphenated phrases can also be written without hyphens, this way the
     * behavior for hyphenated phrases matches the behavior for unhyphenated phrases.
     * In Indonesian we normally don't want to treat hyphens as word boundaries, but in this case it makes sense because
     * in Indonesian you can also have function words seperated by hyphens (e.g. 'dua-lima').
     * As a downside, single function words containing hyphens (e.g. 'vis-Ã -vis') won't be automatically matched, but we
     * are solving this by adding each word from such function words as separate entries in the function words lists.
