/*
*  The following regex is used to split a text into tokens.
 * The regex matches word separators. A word separator is either a whitespace, a slash, a
 * tab, a non-breaking space, a hyphen, an en-dash or an em-dash.
 * Opening and closing square brackets are added to deal correctly with shortcodes downstream.
 * The regex is used to split a text into tokens.
 * Do not add punctuation marks to this regex, as they are handled separately inside `createPunctuationTokens()`.
 * The word separator explicitly only contains characters that split two words and not a word and a space.
 * - A space is a word separator because it separates two words if it occurs between them. For example: "foo bar"
 * - A tab is a word separator because it separates two words if it occurs between them. For example: "foo	bar"
 * - A non-breaking space (u00A0) is a word separator because it separates two words if it occurs between them. For example: "foo\u00A0bar".
 * - An en-dash (u2013), an em-dash (u2014), and a hyphen (u002d) are word separators because they separate two words if they occur between them.
 *   For example: "fooâ€“bar".
 * Note that &nbsp; is added here as #nbsp; -- we transform the & to # to prevent parse5 from converting it to a space and messing up highlighting.

/**
 * Tokenizes a text similarly to `getWords`, but in a way that's suitable for the HTML parser.
 * 1. It does not normalize whitespace.
 * This operation is too risky for the HTML parser because it may throw away characters and as a result, the token positions are corrupted.
 * 2. It does not remove punctuation marks but keeps them.
 *
 * This algorithm splits the text by word separators: tokens that are the border between two words.
 * This algorithm separates punctuation marks from words and keeps them as separate tokens.
 * It only splits them off if they appear at the start or the end of a word.
 *
 * @param {string} text The text to tokenize.
 *
 * @returns {string[]} 	An array of tokens.
