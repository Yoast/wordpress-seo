// Guidelines for adding feedback strings:
// 1) This file is for strings that can only be used for age assessments. If a string can be also used for other
// assessments, add it to the generalFeedbackStrings.js file instead.
// 2) Before adding a new string, check whether a similar string that can be used instead already exists (also in generalFeedbackStrings.js).

/*
 * The last sentence of strings for the non-inclusive terms for 'older people/person'.
 *
 * "Or, if possible, be specific about the group you are referring to (e.g. %3$s)."
