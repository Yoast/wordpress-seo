# Overview of the Readability assessments scoring criteria
These are the scoring criteria applied when using the product pages content assessor.

Readability analysis is a collection of assessments that check how easy to read a text is.

Some of the readability assessments are language-independent (e.g. paragraph length, subheading distribution), but many are language-specific (e.g. passive voice, transition words) and are made available for different languages on a case-by-case basis.
For more information on each language, you can check the documentation on [which language-specific assessments have been adapted to which languages](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/tree/trunk/packages/yoastseo/README.md#readability-analysis).

For information on how the assessments scoring system works, check out these explanations:
* [How are individual traffic lights assigned?](SCORING%20READABILITY.md#how-are-individual-traffic-lights-assigned)
* [How is the overall score calculated?](SCORING%20READABILITY.md#how-is-the-overall-score-calculated)

**Note on URLs in feedback texts**: The URLs used in the feedback texts differ between WordPress and Shopify (the URLs are different but they lead to the same pages).
In this document, only the shortlinks used in WordPress are listed.
