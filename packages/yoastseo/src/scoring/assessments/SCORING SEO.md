#### More on our minimal keyphrase usage requirements
A simple model shows that as the text length (in words) goes up, the keyphrase density assessment requires a larger number of keyphrase usages. This happens in steps, which are determined by keyphrase length (shorter step for shorter keyphrases) and which do not depend on text length. The step size for the shortest keyphrase (1 word) is 214 words.

### 4) Keyphrase in meta description
