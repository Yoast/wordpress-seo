### Unavailable assessments
- Keyphrase in subheadings
- Competing links
- Keyphrase in image alt attributes
- Images
- Previously used keyphrase
- Title

The assessments related to images are unavailable because they might not make sense for this type of content
from an SEO perspective, as we based the collection pages on taxonomy pages analysis where images are not assessed.
In addition, in a collection page, it is advised to have very little content.
