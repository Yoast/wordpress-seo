# Welcome to the Yoast releated keyphrase suggestions package!
A React component library for building user interfaces for Yoast related keyphrase suggestions. 

[View the changelog here](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/trunk/packages/related-keyphrase-suggestions/changelog.md).

For internal use only. Not offering support for external use.

## Local development
The components in this package are developed in isolation inside a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a visual tool for building component libraries. Developing components in isolation helps keep the interfaces flexible while ignoring implementation details.

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Run Storybook for local development
yarn storybook
# Build a static Storybook
yarn build:storybook
```
