## Elements, components & patterns
To improve the flexibility and re-usability of this library its split into three layers: elements, components & patterns. Each layer adds upon the preceding layer in terms of complexity and specificity. The goal of this split is to provide the most useful interfaces for regular use cases, but to remain flexible enough to handle edge case implementations that require a different structure. If, for instance, a component or pattern turns out to be too opinionated, you can always fall back to building with elements only without having to reinvent the wheel entirely.
