# Contributing to the Yoast UI library
The Yoast UI library is a React component library for building Yoast user interfaces. You can contribute to the UI library by adding more stories or creating new components.

## Local development
The components in this library are developed in isolation inside a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a visual tool for building component libraries. Developing components in isolation helps keep the interfaces flexible while ignoring implementation details.

```shell
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Run Storybook for local development
yarn storybook
# Build a static Storybook
yarn build:storybook
```

## Contributions
If you've developed a React component that you think belongs in this library, feel free to reach out to the Components team or open a pull request and request a review from one of the Components teams developers.
