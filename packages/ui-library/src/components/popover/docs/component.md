A popover element is a type of modal interface used to display interactive content or additional information without navigating away from the current page.
Unlike a tooltip, which typically appears on hover and provides brief, non-interactive information, a popover is usually triggered by clicking an element and can contain
richer interactive elements such as buttons, links, forms, or detailed explanations. The popover remains visible until the user explicitly dismisses it, offering a more
persistent and interactive experience than a tooltip.
