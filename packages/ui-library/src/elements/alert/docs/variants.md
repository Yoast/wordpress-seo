We distinguish four different alert variants:


1. **Info (<mark style="background-color: #dbeafe;"><font color="#1e40af">Blue</font></mark>)**<br>
The info alert is used to:
 - inform users about a (changed) system state, an experience, or feature
 - give users an update on any ongoing process
 - provide users with information that does not require any immediate action<br>

The info alert should be easily noticeable but not intrusive, and should not block any user actions.

> Example copy: *Our app will be undergoing maintenance on Friday, March 31st from 8 PM to 10 PM EST.*

2. **Warning (<mark style="background-color: #fef3c7;"><font color="#92400e">Yellow</font></mark>)**<br>
The warning alert is used to:
 - alert users about potential problems or issues that may arise if they proceed with a particular action
 - notify users of a potential security risk, or any other situation that requires attention and/or an action
 - notify users of a condition that might cause a problem in the future

The warning alert, different from an error alert, appears **before** someone takes an action to indicate a significant change or potential loss of data.

> Example copy: *Proceeding with this action will permanently delete all data associated with your account. Are you sure you want to continue?*

3. **Success (<mark style="background-color: #dcfce7;"><font color="#166534">Green</font></mark>)**<br>
The success alert is used to:
 - confirm that a particular action, task, or process has been completed successfully
 - provide users with positive feedback

The success alert can be used to inform users that their action has been processed, a payment has been made, or any other successful completion of a process.

> Example copy: *Your payment has been received. Thank you for your purchase!*

4. **Error (<mark style="background-color: #fee2e2;"><font color="#991b1b">Red</font></mark>)**<br>
The error alert is used to:
 - indicate that an error occurs or has occurred (often while performing a particular action)
 - provide users with information about why the error occurred, what went wrong and how to fix it (or at least move forward)
 - inform users about critical issues that negatively affect the functionality of the app

An error alert, different from a warning alert, appears **after** someone has taken an action. The error alert can be used to alert users that their input is invalid, a process has failed, an action cannot be completed, or any other situation that requires immediate attention. Error messages should be concise and avoid irrelevant details.

> Example copy: *There was an error processing your payment. Please check your payment information and try again.*
