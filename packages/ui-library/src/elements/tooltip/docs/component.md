Tooltips provide contextual information about an element when that owning element receives focus or is hovered over, but are otherwise not visible. They are displayed as small boxes containing a brief label or message.

**Note:**
1. _**The aria-describedby attribute**_<br>
The aria-describedby attribute of the element containing the tooltip, is used to establish an association between the tooltip and its trigger element, providing enhanced accessibility for users.

2. _**Position of the parent element**_<br>
The parent element nesting the tooltip should have a relative position. This positioning attribute ensures that the tooltip is positioned relative to its parent element.
