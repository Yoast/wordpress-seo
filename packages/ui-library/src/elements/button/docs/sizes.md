The aforementioned button variants can be used in four different sizes:

1. **Extra large**<br>
The extra large button size is often used ads and upsells that require significant user attention. It can also be useful for touch interfaces, where extra large buttons are easier to tap.

2. **Large**<br>
The large button size is used next to form input fields, by default it has the same height.

3. **Default**<br>
The default button size is used for the vast majority of actions in our user interfaces, including actions such as *Insert a variable*, *Select image*, *View XML sitemap*, *Unlock with Premium*, *Save changes*. It is also used in cards and other areas of the user interface where only a few buttons are present on the page.

4. **Small**<br>
The small button size is very useful for fitting more actions in a smaller space, like in tables. This approach ensures that the user interface remains tidy and uncluttered.

_**Note:** When choosing a button size for a particular situation other than those previously mentioned, it's important to consider the context, hierarchy, proximity, screen size and resolution. The goal should be to choose a size that is appropriate for the information being conveyed, while also maintaining visual balance in the user interface._
