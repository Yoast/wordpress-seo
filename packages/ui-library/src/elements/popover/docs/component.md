A popover element is a type of modal interface used to display interactive content or additional information without navigating away from the current page.
Unlike a tooltip, which is typically brief and appears on hover, a popover is typically triggered by clicking an element and can contain richer content such as links, forms, buttons, or detailed explanations.
It remains visible until the user explicitly dismisses it.
