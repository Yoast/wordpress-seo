In our user interfaces, we distinguish three different badge variants:

1. **Info (<mark style="background-color: #bfdbfe;"><font color="#1e3a8a">Blue</font></mark>)**<br>
The info badge is used to provide additional information or context about a feature or section. In our interfaces, we use blue `New` or `Beta` badges to indicate that a feature is new or in the beta phase. Additionally, we use `Free` badges to indicate which of our courses are available for free. These badges are often placed directly to the right of a feature or section title, or at the top right corner of a card.

2. **Upsell (<mark style="background-color: #fde68a;"><font color="#78350f">Yellow</font></mark>)**<br>
The upsell badge is used to show premium users which features are part of their premium or paid plan, and is typically placed directly to the right of a feature or section title. In our interfaces, the label of this badge is always `Premium`.

3. **Plain (<mark style="background-color: #e2e8f0;"><font color="#0f172a">Gray</font></mark>)**<br>
The plain badge is used to represent a variable, such as in the SEO title or meta description field.
