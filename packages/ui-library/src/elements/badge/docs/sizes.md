The aforementioned badge variants can be used in three different sizes:

1. **Large**<br>
The large badge size is used in combination with a section heading. For reference, in our interfaces, the font-size of a heading is 1 rem.

2. **Default**<br>
The default badge size is typically used in the top right corner of a card or in combination with a setting label (e.g. a label from a toggle or an input field). In our interfaces, the font-size of a setting label is 0.8125 rem.

3. **Small**<br>
The small badge size is typically used in combination with small labels or in smaller spaces, such as sidebar menus.

<font size="2">_**Note:** When choosing a badge size for a particular situation other than those previously mentioned, it's important to consider the context, hierarchy, proximity, screen size and resolution. The goal should be to choose a size that is appropriate for the information being conveyed, while also maintaining visual balance in the user interface._</font>
