## How to use GitHub

If you have purchased one of [our premium plugins](https://yoa.st/1y1), we will give you personal support via email, please see your purchase email for details.


Thanks for your understanding.

## I want to create a patch
Community made patches, localizations, bug reports and contributions are very welcome and help Yoast SEO remain the #1 SEO plugin for WordPress.

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

#### Submitting an issue you found
Make sure your problem does not exist as a ticket already by searching through [the existing issues](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues). If you cannot find anything which resembles your problem, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/new).

#### Fixing an issue

* Fork the repository on GitHub (make sure to use the trunk branch, not master).
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
* Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) and you properly document any new functions, actions and filters following the [documentation standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
* When committing, reference your issue and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'trunk' branch of the Yoast SEO repository.

We will review your pull request and merge when everything is in order. We will help you to make sure the code complies with the standards described above.

#### 'Patch welcome' issues
Some issues are labeled 'patch-welcome'. This means we see the value in the particular enhancement being suggested but have decided for now not to prioritize it. If you however decide to write a patch for it, we'll gladly include it after some code review.
