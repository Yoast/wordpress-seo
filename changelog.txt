= 1.0.3 =

* This release is dedicated to removing options and setting defaults instead. Specifically, the following settings are now defaults without options to change them:
	* Images are now always included in the XML sitemap as Bing no longer breaks on them.
	* Pinging Google and Bing is now a default action as that's the whole point of having XML sitemaps.
	* RSS feeds are now always noindex, followed. No search engine should ever list an RSS feed as a result in the resultpages.
	* Admin, login and registration pages are always noindexed now for the same reason.
	* Search result pages are now always noindex, follow.
	* Subpages of the homepage are now also noindex, follow. It just doesn't make sense to index,follow those especially with the new rel="prev" and rel="next" changes.
* The option to add `nosnippet` and `noarchive` meta tags sitewide has been removed. No one in his right mind would want to do that, and if you do, then adding the robots meta to your template yourself should be doable.
* Pinging search engines with your RSS feed is no longer part of this plugin (as its unneeded because the XML sitemaps do that).
* UTF-8 characters in RSS footer no longer break.

* Added rel=prev and rel=next for paginated posts and pages.
* Removed the interface options for all rel= links, they're off by default now.
* Removed the option to hide the version number. It's very easy to detect the version number anyway so let's not clutter the interface.

		* Moved XML settings to its own options array, cleaning up the settings. This also allows you to save XML Sitemap settings again.
		* Sitemaps now contains all the last updated posts (under 1,000) of one post type in one new XML sitemap, so SE only has to crawl one sitemap per post type.
		* XML Sitemap Index file is now being pushed into cache if a caching plugin is active (by loading it through a cron job).

		* Removed all code that wrote files, as it's no longer needed.
		* Removed all functionality for updating sitemaps after publish, as it's no longer needed (search engines will still be pinged though).
	* Breadcrumbs:
	 	* Support for bbPress (the plugin), breadcrumbs.
		* Fixed bug with blog URL appearing for non-post post_types.
		* Fixed bug with post ancestors being in wrong order.
		* Removed erroneous var_dump.

* Notice: The functionality in the post / page editor has changed quite a bit. Meta descriptions are now generated using the meta descriptions template if no meta description is entered, so it will for instance use the post excerpt, the SEO title is no longer filled automatically BUT it is properly shown in the snippet preview based on your title template. It should work faster, more intuitive and just better in general, but I do need your feedback, let me know if it's an improvement.

		* Fix in XSL path generation on HTTPS admin backends when frontend is normal HTTP.
