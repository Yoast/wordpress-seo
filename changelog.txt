	* Adds realtime content analysis to the Yoast SEO metabox for all post types and taxonomies.

	* Adds a content analysis plugin for parsing shortcodes before the content is analyzed. This means the snippet preview will now take the rendered content of shortcodes into account.

	* Adds a weekly check if the homepage is indexable (in collaboration with [OnPage.org](https://en.onpage.org/lp/yoast/)).
	* Adds possibility to import titles, metas and settings from the WPSEO.de plugin.
	* Adds possibility to set Facebook (Opengraph), Twitter and Google+ metadata for taxonomies.

* Enhancements:
	* We've completely revised the UX of the Yoast SEO metabox. We've introduced multiple sections which in turn can contain one or more tabs.
	* Makes the Yoast SEO metabox on the taxonomy edit page the same as on the post edit page.
	* Makes sure the capability for the General Settings menu is also `wpseo_manage_options_capability`.

    * Adds a JavaScript API for adding content analysis tests, see [YoastSEO.js](https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js).

	* `wpseo_pre_analysis_post_content`. Alternative: [Modifications API](https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js).
	* `wpseo_metadesc_length`. Functionality removed.

This release contains tons and tons of bugfixes and security improvements. Credits for this release largely go to Juliette Reinders Folmer aka [Jrf](http://profiles.wordpress.org/jrf) / [jrfnl](https://github.com/jrfnl).

Also a heartfelt thanks go out to the beta testers who tested all the changes. Special mentions for testers [Woyto](https://github.com/Woyto), [Bnpositive](https://github.com/Bnpositive), [Surbma](https://github.com/Surbma), [DavidCH1](https://github.com/DavidCH1), [TheITJuggler](https://github.com/TheITJuggler), [kletskater](https://github.com/kletskater) who caught a number of bugs and provided us with actionable information to fix these.

This version also incorporates the [SEO Extended](http://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-extended/) plugin functionality into WP SEO with graceful thanks to [Faison](http://profiles.wordpress.org/faison/) and [Scott Offord](http://profiles.wordpress.org/scottofford/) for their great work on this plugin.

**This version contains a lot of changes under the hood which will break backward compatibility, i.e. once you've upgraded, downgrading will break things.** So make sure you make a backup of your settings/database before upgrading.


* Bugfixes
	* Major overhaul of the way the plugin deals with options. This should fix a truck-load of bugs and provides improved security.
	* Major overhaul of the way the plugin deals with post meta values. This should fix a truck-load of bugs and provides improved security.
	* Major overhaul of the way the plugin deals with taxonomy meta values. This should fix a truck-load of bugs and provides improved security.

	* Fixed: Renamed a number of options as they ran the risk of being overwritten by post type/taxonomy options which could get the same name. This may fix some issues where options did not seem to get saved correctly.

	* Fixed: if page specific keywords were set for a static homepage, they would never be shown.
	* Fixed: if only one FB admin was selected, the tag would not be added.
	* Fixed: bug where taxonomies which were on an individual level set to noindex and sitemap include 'auto-detect' would still be shown in the sitemap
	* Fixed: bug in canonical urls where an essential part of the logic was skipped for singular posts/pages
	* Fixed: category rewrite rules could have errors for categories without parent categories.
	* Fixed: bug in delete_sitemaps() - wrong retrieval of needed options.
	* Fixed: HTML sitemaps would sometimes display headers without a link list.
	* Fixed: Breadcrumbs could potentially output an empty element as part of the chain, resulting in two separators in a row.
	* Fixed: Breadcrumbs: even when removing the prefix texts from the admin page, they would sometimes still be included.
	* Improved fixed for possible caching issue when `title_test` option remained set, issue [#627](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/627).
	* Fixed bug in `title_test_helper` where it would pass the wrong information to `update_option()`, related to issue [#627](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/627).
	* Fixed: shortcodes should be removed from ogdesc.

	* Fixed: Admin -> Dashboard -> Failed removal of the meta description from a theme file would still change the relevant internal option as if it had succeeded.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Dashboard -> bug where message about files blocking the sitemap from working would not be removed when it should.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Titles & Meta's -> Post types would show attachments even when attachment redirection to post was enabled.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Import -> Fixed partially broken import functionality for WooThemes SEO framework
	* Fixed: Admin -> Import -> Importing settings from file would not always work due to file/directory permission issues.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Export -> Some values were exported in a way that they couldn't be imported properly again.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Import/Export -> On export, the part of the admin page after export would not be loaded.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Various -> Removed some superfluous hidden fields which could cause issues.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Social -> The same fb user can no longer be added twice as Facebook admin.

	* Admin -> Multi-site -> Added error message when user tries to restore to defaults a non-existent blog (only applies to multi-site installations).

	* Bow out early from displaying the post/taxonomy metabox if the post/taxonomy is not public (no use adding meta data which will never be displayed).
	* Prevent the SEO score filter from displaying on a post type overview page if the metabox has been hidden for the post type as suggested by [coreyworrell](https://github.com/coreyworrell) in issue [#601](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/601).

	* Improved: post meta -> the keyword density calculation for non-latin, non-ideograph languages - i.e. cyrillic, hebrew etc - has been improved. Related issues [#703](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/703), [#681](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/681), [#349](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/349) and [#264](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/264). The keyword density calculation for ideograph based languages such as Japanese and Chinese will not work yet, issue [#145](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/145) remains open.
	* Fixed: post meta -> SEO score indicator -> wpseo_translate_score() would never return score, but always the css value.
	* Fixed: post meta -> SEO score indicator -> wpseo_translate_score() calls were passing unintended wrong parameters
	* Fixed: post meta -> page analysis -> text analysis did not respect the blog character encoding. This may or may not solve a number of related bugs.
	* Fixed: post meta -> often wrong meta value was shown for meta robots follow and meta robots index in post meta box so it appeared as if the chosen value was not saved correctly.
	* Fixed: post meta -> meta robots advanced entry could have strange (invalid) values.
	* Fixed: post meta -> since v1.4.22 importing from other plugins would import data even when the post already had WP SEO values, effectively overwritting (empty by choice) WPSEO fields.
	* Fixed: post meta -> A few of the meta values could contain line breaks where those aren't allowed.

	* Fixed: taxonomy meta -> breadcrumb title entry field would show for taxonomy even when breadcrumbs were not enabled
	* Fixed: taxonomy meta -> bug where W3TC cache for taxonomy meta data wouldn't always be refreshed when it should and sometimes would when it shouldn't

	* Fixed: some things should work better now for must-use installations.
	* Added sanitation/improved validation to $_GET and $_POST variables if/when they are used in a manner which could cause security issues.
	* Fixed: wrong file was loaded for the get_plugin_data() function.
	* Fixed: several bug-sensitive code constructs. This will probably get rid of a number of hard to figure out bugs.
	* Fixed: several html validation issues.
	* Prevent error when theme does not support featured images, issue [#639](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/639) as reported by [kuzudecoletaje](https://github.com/kuzudecoletaje).

* Google Suggest works again, and properly this time.

= 1.0.3 =

* This release is dedicated to removing options and setting defaults instead. Specifically, the following settings are now defaults without options to change them:
	* Images are now always included in the XML sitemap as Bing no longer breaks on them.
	* Pinging Google and Bing is now a default action as that's the whole point of having XML sitemaps.
	* RSS feeds are now always noindex, followed. No search engine should ever list an RSS feed as a result in the resultpages.
	* Admin, login and registration pages are always noindexed now for the same reason.
	* Search result pages are now always noindex, follow.
	* Subpages of the homepage are now also noindex, follow. It just doesn't make sense to index,follow those especially with the new rel="prev" and rel="next" changes.
* The option to add `nosnippet` and `noarchive` meta tags sitewide has been removed. No one in his right mind would want to do that, and if you do, then adding the robots meta to your template yourself should be doable.
* Pinging search engines with your RSS feed is no longer part of this plugin (as its unneeded because the XML sitemaps do that).
* UTF-8 characters in RSS footer no longer break.

* Fixed a bug in the update routine that could cause errors in the backend.
* Enabled OpenGraph meta box on edit screens, first "stab".

= 1.0.2.2 =

* Removed all rel=index, rel=prev etc references that WP core currently uses as they're wrongly implemented.
* Added rel=prev and rel=next for paginated posts and pages.
* Removed the interface options for all rel= links, they're off by default now.
* Removed the option to hide the version number. It's very easy to detect the version number anyway so let's not clutter the interface.

= 1.0.2.1 =

* I missed a case where the next link would point to the current page, fixed it though :)

= 1.0.2 =

* Fixed keyword in slug detection on non-post post types.

		* Removed no longer needed robots_txt code.
		* Proper flushing of rewrites.
		* Fix for sites using index.php in permalinks.
		* Moved XML settings to its own options array, cleaning up the settings. This also allows you to save XML Sitemap settings again.
		* Sitemaps now contains all the last updated posts (under 1,000) of one post type in one new XML sitemap, so SE only has to crawl one sitemap per post type.
		* XML Sitemap Index file is now being pushed into cache if a caching plugin is active (by loading it through a cron job).

		* Removed all code that wrote files, as it's no longer needed.
		* Removed all functionality for updating sitemaps after publish, as it's no longer needed (search engines will still be pinged though).
	* Breadcrumbs:
	 	* Support for bbPress (the plugin), breadcrumbs.
		* Fixed bug with blog URL appearing for non-post post_types.
		* Fixed bug with post ancestors being in wrong order.
