# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-09-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

- Architecture Decisions should be added through a pull request on the git repository.
- Pull requests for Architecture Decisions should be reviewed by at least 2 members of the Tech Council.
- Architecture Decisions will be effective immediately once the pull request has been merged to trunk.

## Consequences

- Pull requests should conform to all active Architecture Decisions.
