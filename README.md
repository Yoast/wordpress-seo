Welcome to the WordPress SEO Github repository
----------------------------------------------

While the documenation for the [WordPress SEO plugin](http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/) can be found on yoast.com, here
you can browse the source of the project, find and discuss open issues and even
[contribute yourself](https://github.com/jdevalk/wordpress-seo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Installation
------------

Here's a [guide on how to install WordPress SEO in your WordPress site](http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/installation/).
If you want to run the Git version though, you have two options:

* You can clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/jdevalk/wordpress-seo.git
* Download it directly as a ZIP file: https://github.com/jdevalk/wordpress-seo/archive/master.zip

This will download the latest development version of WordPress SEO by Yoast. While this version is usually stable,
it is not recommended for use in a production environment.
