== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do the XML Sitemaps in the Yoast SEO plugin work? =

Having an XML sitemap can be beneficial for SEO, as Google can retrieve essential pages of a website very fast, even if the internal linking of a site isn’t flawless.
The sitemap index and individual sitemaps are updated automatically as you add or remove content and will include the post types you want search engines to index. Post Types marked as noindex will not appear in the sitemap. [Learn more about XML Sitemaps](https://yoa.st/3qt).

= How can I add my website to Google Search Console? =

It is straightforward to add your website to Google Search Console.
1. Create a Google Search Console account and login into your account.
2. Click ‘Add a property’ under the search drop-down.
3. Enter your website URL in the box and click ‘Continue’.
4. Click the arrow next to ‘HTML tag’ to expand the option.
5. Copy the meta tag.
6. Log in to your WordPress website.

11. Go back to Google Search Console and click ‘Verify’.

= How do I implement Yoast SEO breadcrumbs? =

The steps below are a temporary solution as manual edits made to theme files may be overwritten with future theme updates. Please contact the theme developer for a permanent solution. We’ve written an article about the [importance of breadcrumbs for SEO](https://yoa.st/3qv).

To implement the [breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qw) function in Yoast SEO, you will have to edit your theme. We recommend that prior to any editing of the theme files, a backup is taken. Your host provider can help you take a backup.
Copy the following code into your theme where you want the breadcrumbs to be. If you are not sure, you will need to experiment with placement:

<code>
<?php
if ( function_exists( 'yoast_breadcrumb' ) ) {
    yoast_breadcrumb( '<p id="breadcrumbs">','</p>' );
}
?>
</code>

Common places where you could place your breadcrumbs are inside your `single.php` and/or `page.php` file just above the page’s title. Another option that makes it really easy in some themes is by just pasting the code in `header.php` at the very end.

In most non-WooTheme themes, this code snippet should not be added to your `functions.php` file.
Alternatively, you can manually add the breadcrumb shortcode to individual posts or pages: `[wpseo_breadcrumb]`

If you need more details or a step by step guide, read our [Implementation guide for Yoast SEO breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qx).

= How do I noindex URLS? =

Yoast SEO provides multiple options for setting a URL or group of URLs to noindex. [Read more about how to do this in this guide](https://yoa.st/3qy/).

= Google shows the wrong description, how do I fix this? =

If you’ve crafted nice meta descriptions for your blog posts, nothing is more annoying than Google showing another description for your site completely in the search result snippet.

Possible causes could be:
1. wrong description in code
2. Google cache is outdated
3. Search term manipulation
4. Google ignored the meta description

You can [read more here on how to solve the issue with the wrong description](https://yoa.st/3qz).

= How often is Yoast SEO updated? =

Yoast SEO is updated every two weeks. If you want to know why, please read [this post on why we release every two weeks](https://yoa.st/3q-)!

= How do I get support? =

As our free plugin is used by millions of people worldwide, we cannot offer you all one on one support. If you have trouble with the Yoast SEO for WordPress plugin, you can get help on the support forums here at [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo/) or by checking out our help center at [yoast.com/help/](https://yoa.st/3r1).

== Changelog ==

= 19.3 =
Release Date: July 12th, 2022

Yoast SEO 19.3 is out today! In this release, we’ve rolled out some improvements to our Schema structured data implementation. In addition, we also added an Insights tab with information about your content, improved our content analyses and a whole lot more. Read more about what's new in Yoast SEO 19.3 in [our release post in English](https://yoa.st/release-12-7-22) or [our release post in Spanish](https://yoa.st/release-12-7-22-spanish)!

Enhancements:

* Adds an Insights tab to the editors which contains the Flesch reading ease score and feedback, (estimated) reading time, and word count. Since the Flesch reading ease score has been moved to the insights tab, it is removed from the readability analysis.
* Changes the `@id` of the main Schema `WebPage` node to be just the permalink for the current page, for interoperability with other plugins.
* Changes the logic of the Schema generation to prefer featured image and in-content images instead of OpenGraph and Twitter images.
* Uses the site logo set in the customizer as the logo in our Schema `Organization` output when a site has not set a logo in the Yoast SEO settings.
* Improves the author meta tag to be displayed only on posts.
* Adds a `wpseo_meta_author` hook to filter the content of the author meta tag.
* Improves sentence recognition for German by disregarding ordinal numbers as potential sentence boundaries.
* Adds canonical HTTP headers from RSS feeds to their parent URLs (for instance your homepage, or specific categories or tags), so the feeds themselves don't show up in search results.
* Makes sure the `link` tag in the RSS feeds' `channel` section links to the most specific URL possible (for instance the category or tag the RSS feed is for) instead of the homepage.
* Makes sure the title separator chosen in Yoast SEO is used for RSS feed titles too.

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug where the focus keyphrase in the Wincher integration table on posts and terms would not be marked with an asterisk.
* Fixes a bug where a warning would be triggered when author data wasn't available for a post.
* Fixes a bug where disabled settings in the General page would be set to `Off` upon saving the settings form.
* Fixes a bug where the desktop preview would show a truncated title, while the title length progress bar and title width assessment would indicate that the title length was still within the limits.
* Fixes a bug where the keyphrase density assessment errors, or fails to mark the found keyphrases in the text, when using keyphrases that include some regular expression control characters, for example brackets.

= 19.2 =
Release Date: June 28th, 2022

Yoast SEO 19.2 is out today! In this release, we've rolled out some improvements to the content and SEO analyses and we've added an integration with WordProof to timestamp privacy pages on the blockchain. Read more about what's new in Yoast SEO 19.2 in [our release post in English](https://yoa.st/release-28-6-22) or [our release post in Spanish](https://yoa.st/release-28-6-22-spanish)!

Enhancements:

* NEW: Adds an integration with WordProof, which allows for improving the trustworthiness of the privacy policy and terms and conditions pages by adding a timestamp.
* Adds support for `webp` images for OpenGraph output.
* Adds a notice that displays when Yoast SEO Premium is installed but not activated prompting the user to activate it.
* Adds a new filter `wpseo_change_home_url` that allows changing the URL checked by the Ryte integration, to support more versatile hosting setups.
* Adds a `meta author` tag to ensure that LinkedIn picks up the name of a post author properly.
* Adds the name of the article author to the `author` section of the `Article` schema piece, to ensure that Pinterest picks up the name of a post author properly.
* Enables sorting on the SEO and readability score columns on the post overview page.
* Ensures the Bing XML sitemap ping is only sent if IndexNow is disabled.
* Prevents XML sitemap pings for blogs that aren't public.
* Improves the content analysis by excluding blockquote HTML elements.
* Improves the sentence recognition by disregarding abbreviations and initials as potential sentence boundaries.
* Improves the text analysis by not splitting sentences on semicolon ;.
* Improves the text analysis by supporting sentence detection for declarative sentences in quotation marks.
* Improves the text analysis in Elementor by not always splitting on ellipsis &#8230; regardless of whether the next sentence has a valid beginning or not.

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug that would cause the First-time configuration to crash when completing indexation with the Yoast admin bar menu hidden.
* Fixes a bug where filtering the OpenGraph and Twitter image to a URL containing ampersands would lead to encoding issues.
* Fixes a bug where HTML tags in the `og:description` meta tag would be displayed encoded instead of being removed completely.
* Fixes a bug where the sitemap `image:loc` URLs containing ampersands would lead to encoding issues.
* Fixes a bug where notices would show an abnormally large heading in Yoast SEO Premium page.

Other:

* Renames the 'Keyphrase in title' SEO assessment to 'Keyphrase in SEO title'.
