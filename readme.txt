You should also check out the [Yoast Local SEO](https://yoa.st/1uu), [Yoast News SEO](https://yoa.st/1uv) and [Yoast Video SEO](https://yoa.st/1uw) extensions to Yoast SEO. They work with the free version of Yoast SEO already, and these premium extensions of course come with support too.

Release Date: May 15th, 2018

Enhancements:
* Adds readability analysis for Russian.
* Improves accessibility.

Bugfixes:

= 7.4.2 =

Release Date: May 2nd, 2018

Bugfixes:

* Fixes an unintended backwards incompatible change which caused "Warning: Illegal string offset ‘url’ in".
