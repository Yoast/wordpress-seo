Improve your WordPress SEO: Write better content and have a fully optimized WordPress site using the WordPress SEO plugin by Yoast.

== Description ==

WordPress out of the box is already technically quite a good platform for SEO, this was true when I wrote my original [WordPress SEO](https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/) article in 2008 (and updated every few months) and it's still true today, but that doesn't mean you can't improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at [Yoast](https://yoast.com/) to improve your site's SEO on *all* needed aspects. While this [WordPress SEO plugin](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  WordPress SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you're writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.

> <strong>Premium Support</strong><br>
> The Yoast team does not provide support for the WordPress SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One on one email support is available to people who bought the [Premium WordPress SEO plugin](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/) only.
> Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too so it might be well worth your investment!
>
> You should also check out the [Local SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/), [News SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/) and [Video SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/) extensions to WordPress SEO, these of course come with support too.

> <strong>Bug Reports</strong><br>
> Bug reports for WordPress SEO are [welcomed on GitHub](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo). Please note GitHub is _not_ a support forum and issues that aren't properly qualified as bugs will be closed.

= Write better content with WordPress SEO =
Using the snippet preview you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short and your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through for organic search results.

= Page Analysis =
The WordPress SEO plugins [Page Analysis](https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/) functionality checks simple things you're bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, if you've written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you've used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.

The plugin also allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.

Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!

= Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization =
While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This WordPress SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:

= Meta & Link Elements =
With the WordPress SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn't show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but only show the first pages in the search results. It's not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your "personal" category, right?

WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, WordPress SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use `rel="next"` and `rel="prev"` link elements in the `head` section of your paginated archives, this plugin adds those automatically, see [this post](https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/ title="rel=next & rel=prev for paginated archives") for more info.

= XML Sitemaps =
WordPress SEO has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google & Bing of the sitemaps existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts & pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.

These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they're created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.

Because of using [XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps](https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/), the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn't be in there.

= RSS Optimization =
Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you're telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the WordPress SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!

= Breadcrumbs =
If your theme is compatible, and themes based on Genesis or by WooThemes for instance often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.

Making your theme compatible isn't hard either, check [these instructions](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/breadcrumbs/).

= Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file =
Using the built-in file editor you can edit your WordPress blogs .htaccess and robots.txt file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.

= Social Integration =
SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined, that's why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.

= Multi-Site Compatible =
This WordPress SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.

= Import & Export functionality =
If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it's not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It's that simple!

= Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins =
If you've used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There's also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins like Robots Meta and RSS footer.

Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the [SEO Data Transporter](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/) plugin, that'll easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg's High Performance SEO and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.

Read [this migration guide](https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/) if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to WordPress SEO.

= WordPress SEO Plugin in your Language! =
Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating WordPress SEO in as much as 24 languages. So far, the translations for French and Dutch are complete, but we still need help on a lot of other languages, so if you're good at translating, please join us at [translate.yoast.com](http://translate.yoast.com).

= News SEO =
Be sure to also check out the premium [News SEO module](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/) if you need Google News Sitemaps. It tightly integrates with WordPress SEO to give you the combined power of News Sitemaps and full Search Engine Optimization.

= 1.5.3.3 =
Release Date: June 2nd, 2014

* Enhancements
	* We've added some options and some host specific info to our tracking class. Most notably, we're tracking the PHP version for our users now, so we can see whether we, at some point, might drop PHP 5.2 support before WordPress does.
	* Auto-deactivate plugin in the rare case that the SPL (Standard PHP Library) extension is not available.
	* Switch from inline `xmlns` to inline use of the `prefix` attribute for breadcrumbs as that makes validation work. Fixes [Issue 1186]((https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/1186).

This release contains tons and tons of bugfixes and security improvements. Credits for this release largely go to Juliette Reinders Folmer aka [Jrf](http://profiles.wordpress.org/jrf) / [jrfnl](https://github.com/jrfnl).

Also a heartfelt thanks go out to the beta testers who tested all the changes. Special mentions for testers [Woyto](https://github.com/Woyto), [Bnpositive](https://github.com/Bnpositive), [Surbma](https://github.com/Surbma), [DavidCH1](https://github.com/DavidCH1), [TheITJuggler](https://github.com/TheITJuggler), [kletskater](https://github.com/kletskater) who caught a number of bugs and provided us with actionable information to fix these.

This version also incorporates the [SEO Extended](http://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-extended/) plugin functionality into WP SEO with graceful thanks to [Faison](http://profiles.wordpress.org/faison/) and [Scott Offord](http://profiles.wordpress.org/scottofford/) for their great work on this plugin.

**This version contains a lot of changes under the hood which will break backward compatibility, i.e. once you've upgraded, downgrading will break things.** So make sure you make a backup of your settings/database before upgrading.


* Bugfixes
	* Major overhaul of the way the plugin deals with options. This should fix a truck-load of bugs and provides improved security.
	* Major overhaul of the way the plugin deals with post meta values. This should fix a truck-load of bugs and provides improved security.
	* Major overhaul of the way the plugin deals with taxonomy meta values. This should fix a truck-load of bugs and provides improved security.

	* Fixed: Renamed a number of options as they ran the risk of being overwritten by post type/taxonomy options which could get the same name. This may fix some issues where options did not seem to get saved correctly.

	* Fixed: if page specific keywords were set for a static homepage, they would never be shown.
	* Fixed: if only one FB admin was selected, the tag would not be added.
	* Fixed: bug where taxonomies which were on an individual level set to noindex and sitemap include 'auto-detect' would still be shown in the sitemap
	* Fixed: bug in canonical urls where an essential part of the logic was skipped for singular posts/pages
	* Fixed: category rewrite rules could have errors for categories without parent categories.
	* Fixed: bug in delete_sitemaps() - wrong retrieval of needed options.
	* Fixed: HTML sitemaps would sometimes display headers without a link list.
	* Fixed: Breadcrumbs could potentially output an empty element as part of the chain, resulting in two separators in a row.
	* Fixed: Breadcrumbs: even when removing the prefix texts from the admin page, they would sometimes still be included.
	* Improved fixed for possible caching issue when `title_test` option remained set, issue [#627](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/627).
	* Fixed bug in `title_test_helper` where it would pass the wrong information to `update_option()`, related to issue [#627](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/627).
	* Fixed: shortcodes should be removed from ogdesc.

	* Fixed: Admin -> Dashboard -> Failed removal of the meta description from a theme file would still change the relevant internal option as if it had succeeded.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Dashboard -> bug where message about files blocking the sitemap from working would not be removed when it should.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Titles & Meta's -> Post types would show attachments even when attachment redirection to post was enabled.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Import -> Fixed partially broken import functionality for WooThemes SEO framework
	* Fixed: Admin -> Import -> Importing settings from file would not always work due to file/directory permission issues.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Export -> Some values were exported in a way that they couldn't be imported properly again.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Import/Export -> On export, the part of the admin page after export would not be loaded.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Various -> Removed some superfluous hidden fields which could cause issues.
	* Fixed: Admin -> Social -> The same fb user can no longer be added twice as Facebook admin.

	* Admin -> Multi-site -> Added error message when user tries to restore to defaults a non-existent blog (only applies to multi-site installations).

	* Bow out early from displaying the post/taxonomy metabox if the post/taxonomy is not public (no use adding meta data which will never be displayed).
	* Prevent the SEO score filter from displaying on a post type overview page if the metabox has been hidden for the post type as suggested by [coreyworrell](https://github.com/coreyworrell) in issue [#601](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/601).

	* Improved: post meta -> the keyword density calculation for non-latin, non-ideograph languages - i.e. cyrillic, hebrew etc - has been improved. Related issues [#703](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/703), [#681](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/681), [#349](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/349) and [#264](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/264). The keyword density calculation for ideograph based languages such as Japanese and Chinese will not work yet, issue [#145](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/145) remains open.
	* Fixed: post meta -> SEO score indicator -> wpseo_translate_score() would never return score, but always the css value.
	* Fixed: post meta -> SEO score indicator -> wpseo_translate_score() calls were passing unintended wrong parameters
	* Fixed: post meta -> page analysis -> text analysis did not respect the blog character encoding. This may or may not solve a number of related bugs.
	* Fixed: post meta -> often wrong meta value was shown for meta robots follow and meta robots index in post meta box so it appeared as if the chosen value was not saved correctly.
	* Fixed: post meta -> meta robots advanced entry could have strange (invalid) values.
	* Fixed: post meta -> since v1.4.22 importing from other plugins would import data even when the post already had WP SEO values, effectively overwritting (empty by choice) WPSEO fields.
	* Fixed: post meta -> A few of the meta values could contain line breaks where those aren't allowed.

	* Fixed: taxonomy meta -> breadcrumb title entry field would show for taxonomy even when breadcrumbs were not enabled
	* Fixed: taxonomy meta -> bug where W3TC cache for taxonomy meta data wouldn't always be refreshed when it should and sometimes would when it shouldn't

	* Fixed: some things should work better now for must-use installations.
	* Added sanitation/improved validation to $_GET and $_POST variables if/when they are used in a manner which could cause security issues.
	* Fixed: wrong file was loaded for the get_plugin_data() function.
	* Fixed: several bug-sensitive code constructs. This will probably get rid of a number of hard to figure out bugs.
	* Fixed: several html validation issues.
	* Prevent error when theme does not support featured images, issue [#639](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/639) as reported by [kuzudecoletaje](https://github.com/kuzudecoletaje).

	* Post meta -> Added an option to decide whether to include/exclude `rel="author"` on a per post base as suggested by [GaryJones](https://github.com/GaryJones). (Added to the advanced meta box).
	* Taxonomy meta -> Don't show robots index/no-index choice in taxonomy meta box if there is a blog-wide override in place, i.e. the Settings -> Reading -> Block search engines checkbox is checked.

	* Admin -> Titles & Meta -> Added option to add meta keywords to post type archives.
	* Admin -> Social -> Facebook -> Added error messages for if communication with Facebook failed.

	* [Usability] Proper field labels for user profile form fields.
	* The New Relic daemon (not the W3TC New Relic PHP module) realtime user monitoring will be turned off for xml/xsl files by default to prevent breaking the sitemaps as suggested by [szepeviktor](https://github.com/szepeviktor) in [issue #603](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/603)
