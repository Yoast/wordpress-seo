== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do the XML Sitemaps in the Yoast SEO plugin work? =

Having an XML sitemap can be beneficial for SEO, as Google can retrieve essential pages of a website very fast, even if the internal linking of a site isn’t flawless.
The sitemap index and individual sitemaps are updated automatically as you add or remove content and will include the post types you want search engines to index. Post Types marked as noindex will not appear in the sitemap. [Learn more about XML Sitemaps](https://yoa.st/3qt).

= How can I add my website to Google Search Console? =

It is straightforward to add your website to Google Search Console.
1. Create a Google Search Console account and login into your account.
2. Click ‘Add a property’ under the search drop-down.
3. Enter your website URL in the box and click ‘Continue’.
4. Click the arrow next to ‘HTML tag’ to expand the option.

= How do I implement Yoast SEO breadcrumbs? =

The steps below are a temporary solution as manual edits made to theme files may be overwritten with future theme updates. Please contact the theme developer for a permanent solution. We’ve written an article about the [importance of breadcrumbs for SEO](https://yoa.st/3qv).

To implement the [breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qw) function in Yoast SEO, you will have to edit your theme. We recommend that prior to any editing of the theme files, a backup is taken. Your host provider can help you take a backup.
Copy the following code into your theme where you want the breadcrumbs to be. If you are not sure, you will need to experiment with placement:

```
<?php
if ( function_exists( 'yoast_breadcrumb' ) ) {
    yoast_breadcrumb( '<p id="breadcrumbs">','</p>' );
}
?>
```

Common places where you could place your breadcrumbs are inside your `single.php` and/or `page.php` file just above the page’s title. Another option that makes it really easy in some themes is by just pasting the code in `header.php` at the very end.

In most non-WooTheme themes, this code snippet should not be added to your `functions.php` file.
Alternatively, you can manually add the breadcrumb shortcode to individual posts or pages: `[wpseo_breadcrumb]`

If you need more details or a step by step guide, read our [Implementation guide for Yoast SEO breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qx).

= How do I noindex URLS? =

Yoast SEO provides multiple options for setting a URL or group of URLs to noindex. [Read more about how to do this in this guide](https://yoa.st/3qy/).

= Google shows the wrong description, how do I fix this? =

If you’ve crafted nice meta descriptions for your blog posts, nothing is more annoying than Google showing another description for your site completely in the search result snippet.

Possible causes could be:
1. wrong description in code
2. Google cache is outdated
3. Search term manipulation
4. Google ignored the meta description

You can [read more here on how to solve the issue with the wrong description](https://yoa.st/3qz).

= How often is Yoast SEO updated? =

Yoast SEO is updated every two weeks. If you want to know why, please read [this post on why we release every two weeks](https://yoa.st/3q-)!

= How do I get support? =

As our free plugin is used by millions of people worldwide, we cannot offer you all one on one support. If you have trouble with the Yoast SEO for WordPress plugin, you can get help on the support forums here at [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo/) or by checking out or knowledge base at [kb.yoast.com](https://yoa.st/3r1).

== Changelog ==

= 15.1.1 =
Release Date: October 15th, 2020

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug where the indexing button on the Tools page would keep showing up because certain objects would be detected as requiring indexing but would not actually be indexed during the indexing process.

= 15.1 =
Release Date: October 14th, 2020

Wouldn’t it be cool if you could get keyword data while working on your content in Yoast SEO? Well, we asked ourselves that same question and now we have an answer! Yes, you can now find related keyphrases inside the post editor. And it’s not any old data — no, it’s powered by our good friends at SEMrush, a world-class provider of SEO and internet marketing tools! Read more about what’s new in 15.1 in [our release post](https://yoa.st/release-15-1)!

Enhancements:

* Adds an integration with SEMrush to search for and compare search volume of related keyphrases.
* Moves the Ryte feature toggle to the new Integrations tab where the new SEMrush feature toggle also can be found.
* Merges the indexable and link indexing tools on the tools page into one process.
* Improves the user experience of the indexing tool on the tools page by showing its progress on the tools page itself, instead of in a separate pop-up modal.
* Prevents several processes from happening on non-production environments:
    * Indexing indexables.
    * Pinging search engines about XML sitemaps.
    * Sending tracking information.
    * Checking the indexability of the site with Ryte.
* Uses the `website` from a user's WordPress profile in that user's `SameAs` array in the Schema output.
* Flushes all permalinks from the indexables tables when the value of the `permalink_structure` option changes, and introduces a notification to ask for a reindex in that case.
* Flushes all permalinks from the indexables tables when the value of the `home_url` option changes, and introduces a notification to ask for a reindex in that case.
* Registers a cron job that checks whether the `home_url` was changed manually and resets the permalinks accordingly.
* Makes it possible to recognize keyphrases in Farsi when they have a negation prefix or an indefinite article (for example: ماشین ('car') in ماشینی ('a car')).
* Improves keyphrase recognition in Farsi by filtering the function words such as `هفت`, چهارم`,`یا`.

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug where the Yoast replacement variables plugin would not be available on edit terms page for usage by other plugins.
* Fixes a bug where the incoming link count for each post, as shown on the post overview page, was incorrect.

Other:

* Adds a filter (`wpseo_dynamic_permalinks_enabled`) to enable the dynamic permalink fallback. When this fallback is enabled, the indexable-based output of the `permalink` property is overridden by a permalink that is calculated on the fly. Using this is detrimental for performance but may be needed for some site setups.
