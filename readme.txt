Note that the [Yoast SEO Premium](https://yoa.st/1v8) also has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords, internal linking suggestions, cornerstone content checks and a redirect manager, so it is well worth your investment!

You should also check out the [Yoast Local SEO](https://yoa.st/1uu), [Yoast News SEO](https://yoa.st/1uv) and [Yoast Video SEO](https://yoa.st/1uw) extensions to Yoast SEO. They work with the free version of Yoast SEO already, and these premium extensions of course come with support too.

== Changelog ==

= 7.4.1 =
Release Date: May 2nd, 2018

Bugfixes:
* Re-adds `wpseo_opengraph_image_size` filter. This will completely override any automatic size determination our code does. This filter now also applies to all ways an `og:image` can be determined: In the content, as a featured image or as set in our Facebook image setting.
* Fixes an unintended backwards incompatible change which caused "Warning: Illegal string offset ‘url’ in".
* Fixes an unintended change which caused SVGs to be included in consideration for the `og:image` tag. SVG images are not allowed by Facebook, so these should never be used in the `og:image` tag.
